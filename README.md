# World-Population-Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes global population trends using historical data to predict future growth. It applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to explore demographic patterns, identify key factors influencing population changes, and build predictive models.

Objective
Analyze historical population trends
Predict future population growth
Identify key demographic factors impacting changes
